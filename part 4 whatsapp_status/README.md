WhatsApp Status Screen Clone

This app is a simplified clone of the WhatsApp Status screen built using Flutter. It displays two sections: Recent Updates and Viewed Updates. Users can see a list of statuses with the user's profile picture, name, and time of update. Additionally, there are floating action buttons to edit or add a new status.
